> You can query the Firebase Auth backend through a REST API. This can be used for various operations such as creating new users, signing in existing ones and editing or deleting these users.  

This plugin offers several methods to call these APIs just with one line of code.

## Signup with Email
```
Firebase.Auth.signup_with_email(email, password)
```

This will create the login_request_body variable and insert the correct data into it.

```gdscript
var login_request_body = {
    "email":"",
    "password":"",
    "returnSecureToken": true
   }
```

From there the script will POST the data to the `signup_request_url` and add the user to the application.  
This method will emit a `signup_succeeded(auth_info : Dictionary)` signal if successful.  
Otherwise, `login_failed(code :, message: String)` will be emitted.  
<p align="right"><a href="#contents-on-this-page">Back</a></p>  


***

## Login with Email
```
Firebase.Auth.login_with_email(email, password)
```
[**Usage Example**](#ex-login-with-email-and-password)

This will create the login_request_body variable and insert the correct data into it.

```gdscript
var login_request_body = {
    "email":"",
    "password":"",
    "returnSecureToken": true
   }
```

From there the script will POST the data to the `signin_request_url`, and wait for a response. The function `func _on_FirebaseAuth_request_completed(result, response_code, headers, body)` will take that response and parse it out for you.  
This method will emit a `login_succeeded(auth_info : Dictionary)` signal if successful.  
Otherwise, `login_failed(code :, message: String)` will be emitted.  

#### Unable to parse body
If the script is unable to parse the body, it will print our an error to the console and 'return' out of the function

#### Body has RESPONSE_SIGNIN, RESPONSE_SIGNUP
If the response body has `RESPONSE_SIGNIN, RESPONSE_SIGNUP`, the user will be logged in and the refresh countdown will start
This refresh is needed for Firebase, as there is a limit to how long a connection can be left open, and you need the connection to stay open for updates

#### Body has RESPONSE_USERDATA
If the response body has `RESPONSE_USERDATA`, the script will emit a signal "userdata_received" with the userdata

#### Body has INVALID_EMAIL, EMAIL_NOT_FOUND, INVALID_PASSWORD, USER_DISABLED or WEAK_PASSWORD
If the response body has `INVALID_EMAIL, EMAIL_NOT_FOUND, INVALID_PASSWORD, USER_DISABLED or WEAK_PASSWORD`, the login has failed and the script will emit a signal "login_failed". It will also pass the error code and error message to be printed into the console
<p align="right"><a href="#contents-on-this-page">Back</a></p> 

***

### Login Anonymously
```gdscript
Firebase.Auth.login_anonymous()
```

This will issue an anonymous request login to Firebase.  
If successful, an anonymous user will be identified with an UUID in users list.  
The UUID will be returned in the response body, if `signup_succeeded` properly connected.  
This method will emit a `signup_succeeded(auth_info : Dictionary)` signal if successful.  
Otherwise, `login_failed(code :, message: String)` will be emitted.  

#### Body has ADMIN_ONLY_OPERATION (400)
If the response body has `ADMIN_ONLY_OPERATION` or an `error 400 ADMIN_ONLY_OPERATION` is returned from `login_failed` signal, Anonymous Sign-in has not been enabled in your project settings.  
To do so, go to `Authentication > Sign-in method` inside your project and enable `Anonymous` (the last one in the list).

### Login with OAuth (Manual)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è OAuth OOB method (manual copy/paste) will be deprecated by Google on October 3, 2022  

```gdscript
Firebase.Auth.get_google_auth_manual()
var oath_token : String = "<An oauth token, taken from the browser. Can be pasted to a LineEdit>"
Firebase.Auth.login_with_oauth(oath_token)
```
[**Usage Example**](#ex-login-with-google-oauth)
  
In order to login with OAuth, [additional configuration passages](https://github.com/GodotNuts/GodotFirebase/wiki/Installation-and-Activation#additional-oauth-configuration) are mandatory. This is due to Google requirements with WEB applications.  
Once the configuration is completed, call the `Firebase.Auth.get_google_auth_manual()` to open user's web browser redirecting to a Google Access page.  
Here the user can chose whatever Google account prefers to give permissions to log in.  
Once an account is selected, the user will be redirected to a page containing the oath token required to log in your app.  
The oath token could be pasted to a LineEdit or a custom editable text Control, then to log in with oauth call the `Firebase.Auth.login_with_oauth(oauth_token)` with `oauth_token` being the pasted token. Can directly be `$LineEdit.get_text()`.  
If login was successful, the response body will contain all user's informations related to the Google account. The user account will be listed.  
This method will emit a `login_succeeded(auth_info : Dictionary)` signal if successful.  
Otherwise, `login_failed(code :, message: String)` will be emitted.  

<p align="right"><a href="#contents-on-this-page">Back</a></p>

***

### Login with OAuth (Automatic)
```gdscript
Firebase.Auth.connect("login_succeeded", self, "_on_login")

Firebase.Auth.get_auth_localhost(provider, port) # (a)

Firebase.Auth.get_auth_redirect(provider) # (b)
```
[**Usage Example**](#ex-login-with-google-oauth)  

### Destkop
üñ•Ô∏è If your application will be published only for **Desktop** users and you **don't have a web hosting environment** where to redirect users, you can use (a) `Firebase.Auth.get_auth_localhost(provider, port)` to let OAuth2 flow redirect users directly to a static page provided by our plugin.

In this case, the application will listen on `localhost:<port>` for the access token coming from your provider OAuth2 flow, and the user will be automatically logged in.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è When setting up your provider, remember to add to the redirect URIs list `http://localhost:<port>`  


### HTML5
üåê If your application will be published for HTML5 too, our plugin will be able to explot browser redirects to make a browser-compliant OAuth2 flow. You can even add this logic to your Desktop preexistent logic.
```gdscript
    # if OS.get_name() == "HTML5"
    var provider: AuthProvider = Firebase.Auth.get_<your provider>()
    var token = Firebase.Auth.get_token_from_url(provider)
	# If your project is hosted on `https://<your_site>/<your_app>`
	# Firebase.Auth.set_redirect_uri("https://<your_site>/<your_app>.html")
    if token == null:
        Firebase.Auth.get_auth_with_redirect(provider)
    else:
        Firebase.Auth.connect("login_succeeded", self, "_on_login")
        Firebase.Auth.login_with_oauth(token, provider)
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è When testing HTML5 locally, remember to add to the redirect URIs list `http://localhost:<port>/tmp_js_export.html`.  

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Once your HTML5 app is web-hosted, remember to add to the redirect URIs list `https://<your_site>/<your_app_name>.html` and set the redirect uri accordingly in GDScript.  

In order to login with OAuth, [additional configuration passages](https://github.com/GodotNuts/GodotFirebase/wiki/Installation-and-Activation#additional-oauth-configuration) are mandatory.

### Save Encrypted Auth File
```gdscript
Firebase.Auth.save_auth(auth)
```

This function is used to store the returned auth data after logging in to an encrypted file on any device. This file can be used to keep a user signed in and not force them to login every time they open the application. This uses the `apiKey` configured in your `.env` file to secure the auth file with a password.

<p align="right"><a href="#contents-on-this-page">Back</a></p> 

***

### Check Encrypted Auth File
```gdscript
Firebase.Auth.check_auth_file()
```

This function is used to check if the encrypted auth file exists on the device. The function checks the location used by the function `save_auth()`, and if the file is there it will load it for you.

<p align="right"><a href="#contents-on-this-page">Back</a></p> 

***

### Load Encrypted Auth File
```gdscript
Firebase.Auth.load_auth()
```

This function is used to load the data from an encrypted auth file saved with the function `save_auth()`. It will take the data and overwrite the current state of the variable `auth`. This function has no logic check to make sure the file exists, for that please use the function `check_auth_file()`

<p align="right"><a href="#contents-on-this-page">Back</a></p> 

***

### Verify User Account
```gdscript
Firebase.Auth.send_account_verification_email()
```

This function is used to send an account verification to an email associated with an ID. This will auto generate the account_verification_body and insert the correct data. This is best used after the user registers their account.

```gdscript
var account_verification_body = {
	"requestType":"verify_email",
	"idToken":"",
   }
```

From there the script will POST the data to the `oobcode_request_url`, and wait for a response. The email associated with the ID will receive an email with a link to verify their account.

<p align="right"><a href="#contents-on-this-page">Back</a></p> 


***

### Get User Data
```
Firebase.Auth.get_user_data()
```

This function returns all the information for the currently logged in user by send the current ID Token. The script will post the data to the `userdata_request_url`, and wait for a response.  
This method will emit a `userdata_received(userdata : FirebaseUserData)` signal if successful.  

<p align="right"><a href="#contents-on-this-page">Back</a></p> 

***

### Change User Email
> Note that there is no verify step here. This function will change the email as soon as it is run
```
Firebase.Auth.change_user_email(email)
```

This function is used to change the email address associated with the currently logged in user account. This function generates the change_email_body and inserts the correct data.

```gdscript
var change_email_body = {
	"idToken":"",
	"email":"",
	"returnSecureToken": true,
   }
```

From there the script will post the data to the `update_account_request_url`, and wait for a response. The email for the associated user will then be updated in Firebase. Note that this function is for a user to change their own email, an admin can edit the email with the Web GUI.

<p align="right"><a href="#contents-on-this-page">Back</a></p> 

***

### Change User Password
> Note that there is no verify step here. This function will change the password as soon as it is run
```
Firebase.Auth.change_user_password(password)
```

This function is used to change the password associated with the currently logged in user account. This function generates the change_password_body and inserts the correct data.

```gdscript
var change_password_body = {
	"idToken":"",
	"password":"",
	"returnSecureToken": true,
   }
```

From there the script will post the data to the `update_account_request_url`, and wait for a response. The password for the associated user will then be updated in Firebase. Note that this function is for a user to change their own password.

<p align="right"><a href="#contents-on-this-page">Back</a></p> 

***

### Send Password Reset Email
```
Firebase.Auth.send_password_reset_email(email)
```

This function is used to send a password reset email to a user. The function requires the email of the user who needs to be reset. It generates the password_reset_body and inserts all the correct data.

```gdscript
var password_reset_body = {
	"requestType":"password_reset",
	"email":"",
   }
```

From there the script will POST the data to the `oobcode_request_url`, and wait for a response. The user will get an email from the system with a link to reset their password. 

<p align="right"><a href="#contents-on-this-page">Back</a></p> 

***

### Delete User Account
> Note that there is no verify step here. This function will delete the user account as soon as it is run
```
Firebase.Auth.delete_user_account()
```

This function is used to delete the user account from Firebase for the currently logged in user by sending the current ID Token. The script will post the data to the `delete_account_request_url`.

This should be used with extreme caution as there is no restoring an account once it is gone. Note that this function is for a user to delete their own account, an admin can also do this via the Web GUI.
